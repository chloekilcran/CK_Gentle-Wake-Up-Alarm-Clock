# Gentle Wake Up Alarm Project

The Gentle Wake-Up Alarm Clock was initially conceptualised as a reinterpretation of an existing everyday device, enhanced with innovative features designed to encourage a gradual and calm transition from sleep to wakefulness. Throughout this process, I have learnt how to utilise new applications and devices inlcuding Arduino, as well as code using C++ programming language.

In this Git Repository I have uploaded various files including:
My Final Code on Arduino,
A Draft Code for creating a melody,
Presentation Slides,
Presentation Script,
Project Journal and
a Progression Video
